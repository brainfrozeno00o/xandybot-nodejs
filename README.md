# XandyBot

This Discord bot does all the shenanigans Rene Alexander S. Castillo does in real life. The funding[^1] for this bot is also sponsored by him... I wish I have generational wealth like he has, it's really hard to be poor and ugly.

## Current Features

- Bot sending a random quote every day at 8:00 AM UTC+8 to the `#general` channel of your server.
- Bot changes its status depending on the time of day. This actually reflects on what the real Xander Castillo does on a daily basis.
- Bot now has its own help command by running `%helphelphelp {command|alias}` where the command or alias argument is optional.
- Bot will also give a random answer to a specific statement by running `%lgtm {statement}`
- Bot does a callout `HOY @Blitz` every time SJG says something in any channel in a server where **both** the bot and SJG are present. It has a cooldown of an hour before the bot can call him out again.
- Bot can give a random quote upon the request of a user. This **should not** affect the scheduled sending of random quotes.
- Bot can give a random image of the real Xander Castillo.

## Future Features

- Bot can play K-pop songs catered to the real Xander Castillo's liking.

## Prerequisites

### Tools Required To Run Locally

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) - any version would suffice
- Your own Discord account - you'll have to create your own bot if you want to run this locally **OR** you can join the [XandyBot](https://discord.gg/vAtFk8n9B2) Discord server to have a development bot assigned to you

### Some Helpful Tools

- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) - helpful tool if you want UI for the database
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) - another helpful tool if you want UI for the database

## Running the Bot

### Setting Up Your Own Discord Bot and Inviting it to Your Own Server

**NOTE**: This is assuming you have your own Discord account. If not, then please create one :smile:\
**ANOTHER NOTE**: You can skip this part if you are in the XandyBot Discord server. We'll just give you personally the token and the invite link in that case. <a name="TOKEN_NOTE"></a>

1. Navigate to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click on the "New Application" button.
3. Give your own application a name (e.g. XanderCastillo) and click "Create".
4. Go to the "Bot" tab, and then click "Add Bot". If a prompt appears, just confirm it.
5. The next step is to copy the token of your bot. This token is **confidential** and not really meant to be shared with others (unless needed). You will use the value of this token on the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable. <a name="TOKEN_STEP"></a>
6. Proceed to the "OAuth2" tab and select the "bot" and "applications.commands" option under the "Scopes" section.
7. For the permissions, choose the "Administrator" permission.
   - **NOTE**: Be careful when choosing the "Administrator" permission as this gives full usage of all the Discord development options for the bot. When releasing to production, be wary of what permissions the bot really needs.
8. After selecting the appropriate permissions, click the "Copy" button in the "Scopes" section and invite the bot to your own server.
   - For creating your own Discord server, please refer to this [helpful link](https://discord.com/blog/starting-your-first-discord-server).
   - After creating a server, create a text channel named `xander-bot-test-channel`. Refer again to this [helpful link](https://discord.com/blog/starting-your-first-discord-server#:~:text=To%20make%20a%20new%20channel,and%20choose%20%E2%80%9Ccreate%20channel.%E2%80%9D) if you are having problems creating a text channel.

### Setting Up the Database

**NOTE**: Once PostgreSQL is installed in your local machine, please ensure that you can run it via command line and it is fully configured. This is because the steps found in this README will make full use of the command line.

1. Open `psql` in the command line by running: `psql -U {username}`
2. Enter your password when prompted.
3. Once logged in, create the database `xdy_bot` by running: `CREATE DATABASE xdy_bot;`
4. If you have seen the `CREATE DATABASE` response, then it's all good.
5. If you want to make sure that you have _really_ created the database, you can run:\
   `SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname = 'xdy_bot'`\
   If it shows a row, then it's there.
6. To exit `psql` from the command line, run `\q`

### Setting the Environment Variables

Please refer to the `.env.example` regarding the needed variables when running the bot in your local environment. Create your own `.env` in the root directory and you can use these recommended values.

### Setting Up The Virtual Environment and Running the Bot Locally

TBD for now since new language is being used

[^1]: Everything (bot, source code, server) is really sponsored by Xander's money.
